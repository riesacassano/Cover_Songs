```

This notebook calculates basic descriptors of the memory dataset.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
```

Load the data.
```{r}
data <- read_csv('../../data/processed/dense/joined_with_features/memory_original-w_or_wo_cover_memories.csv')
all_wide <- read_csv('../../data/processed/dense/memory/main_task_wider.csv')
```

There are 1213 original memories.
```{r}
data %>% filter(memory_cover)
```
There are 630 cover memories, given that a memory was evoked for the original.

```{r}
all_wide %>%
  filter(memory_cover) %>%
  filter(!memory_orig)
```
There are another 245 cover memories where there was not a memory for the corresponding original.
